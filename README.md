# :rotating_light: DEPRECATED :rotating_light:
homebridge-homeassistant has been deprecated since Home Assistant has natively supported
HomeKit since version 0.64. For more information on how to configure native HomeKit support
please see the documentation [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/homekit/).
We **STRONGLY** suggest to migrate to the Home Assistant HomeKit component.

Trying to use this in favor of an external running homebridge instance. Doing this
because the docker instance (on Windows host) of HomeAssistant with HomeBridge is not found
by Homekit.
